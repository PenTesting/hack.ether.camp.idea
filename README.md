## or securing document validity with blockchain immunibility

### What is a PDF report:
The Portable Document Format (commonly referred to as PDF) is a file format used to present documents in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.[2] Each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, fonts, graphics, and other information needed to display it.

### What is the Blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed, append-only database hardened against tampering and revision that provides a single shared source of cryptographically verifiable truth. The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward possible future standardization and interoperability of blockchains and ledgers. The use cases in this document focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.
